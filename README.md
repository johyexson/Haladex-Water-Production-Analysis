# Introduction
Haladex Water Production Company is an industry that specializes in the manufacturing and production of satchet and bottled water. During my quest to volunteer as a data analyst for production companies in order to gain hands-on experience in the field, I got a referral from a company I once volunteered for and I was approached by Haladex's manager who expressed interest in having me analyse their production and sales records to determine how sales growth can be enhanced.
